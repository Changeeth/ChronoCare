# ChronoCare Simulation ‚Äì ESP32 (Embedded Systems Project)

This repository contains the implementation of **Programming Assignment 1** for the course **EN2853: Embedded Systems and Applications**.  
The project demonstrates a **ChronoCare** simulation built on **Wokwi** using an ESP32 microcontroller. The ChronoCare is designed to remind users to take their medicine on time and monitor environmental conditions.
